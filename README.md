The main purpose of this project is to help entrepreneurial ventures in developing countries to survive, grow and thrive with the help of organizational sponsorship. TechnoServe specifically chose small to middle-sized businesses in these countries as a means of promoting poverty-alleviation because their goal focused around promoting growth. More specifically, this study was to explore which programs influence venture growth in the context of poverty. We are trying to explore differences in entrepreneurial growth by constructing reasonable models of log monthly sales among several different venture characteristics.
